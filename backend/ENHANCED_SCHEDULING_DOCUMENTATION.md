# Enhanced Scheduling System Documentation

## Overview

The Enhanced Scheduling System implements a sophisticated algorithm for assigning Y tasks and weekend closing assignments to workers. This system prioritizes fairness, context awareness, and workload balance while handling complex scenarios like X task conflicts and Rituk exceptions.

## Key Features

### 1. Context-Aware Scoring System
- **Lower scores = Higher priority**: The system uses a reversed scoring logic where lower scores indicate higher priority for task assignments
- **Persistent score tracking**: Worker scores are maintained across scheduling sessions
- **Fairness adjustments**: Automatic adjustments based on workload balance
- **Qualification balancing**: Workers with rare qualifications get priority for those tasks

### 2. X Task Proximity Analysis
- **Proximity penalties**: Workers with recent or upcoming X tasks receive penalties
- **Rituk exceptions**: Workers with Rituk X tasks get priority and bypass proximity penalties
- **Context-aware filtering**: Workers are filtered based on X task timing and type
- **Warning system**: Users receive warnings about potential X task conflicts

### 3. Weekend vs Weekday Logic
- **Weekend priority**: Weekend closers get Y tasks on their closing weekends
- **Two-phase processing**: Weekends are processed first, then weekdays
- **Enhanced caching**: Weekend assignments are cached to prevent conflicts
- **Performance optimization**: Local caching improves assignment efficiency

### 4. Violation Bonus System
- **Context-aware bonuses**: Violation bonuses consider X task timing
- **Rituk exceptions**: Rituk workers receive no violation bonuses
- **Proximity enhancement**: Additional bonuses for workers with upcoming X tasks
- **Fairness preservation**: Bonuses are balanced with overall fairness

## Algorithm Components

### ScoreKeeper Class
Manages worker scores and ensures fair task distribution:

```python
class ScoreKeeper:
    def update_worker_score(self, worker, assignment_type, date)
    def get_fairness_adjustment(self, worker)
    def get_qualification_balancing_adjustment(self, worker, task)
```

**Key Methods:**
- `update_worker_score()`: Updates worker scores based on assignments (X tasks don't add to score)
- `get_fairness_adjustment()`: Calculates fairness adjustments based on workload balance
- `get_qualification_balancing_adjustment()`: Prioritizes workers with scarce qualifications

### SchedulerEngine Class
Main scheduling engine with enhanced logic:

```python
class SchedulerEngine:
    def assign_y_tasks(self, start_date, end_date)
    def get_weekend_closing_candidates(self, workers, current_week)
    def _calculate_y_task_score(self, worker, task, current_date)
```

**Key Methods:**
- `assign_y_tasks()`: Main assignment method with two-phase processing
- `get_weekend_closing_candidates()`: Identifies eligible weekend closers
- `_calculate_y_task_score()`: Calculates context-aware scores for Y task assignments

## Scoring Logic

### Base Score Components
1. **Worker's persistent score**: Higher scores = more overworked = lower priority
2. **Qualification penalty**: More qualifications = higher penalty
3. **Task-specific qualification bonus**: Qualified workers get priority
4. **Workload penalty**: Overworked workers get higher penalties
5. **Fairness adjustment**: Balances workload across workers
6. **Qualification balancing**: Prioritizes scarce qualifications
7. **Recent Y task penalties**: Penalizes workers with recent assignments
8. **X task proximity penalties**: Penalizes workers with X task conflicts

### Context-Aware Adjustments
- **Rituk priority**: Rituk workers get significant priority bonuses
- **Weekend closer priority**: Weekend closers get priority on weekends
- **Overdue bonuses**: Overdue workers get priority for closing assignments
- **X task proximity**: Context-aware penalties based on X task timing

## Assignment Strategy

### Phase 1: Weekend Processing
1. **Identify weekend closers**: Find workers assigned to close on weekends
2. **Prioritize weekend closers**: Give them Y tasks for Thursday-Saturday
3. **Enhanced scoring**: Use context-aware scoring for weekend assignments
4. **Cache assignments**: Store weekend assignments to prevent conflicts

### Phase 2: Weekday Processing
1. **Standard assignments**: Assign Y tasks for Sunday-Wednesday
2. **Availability filtering**: Filter workers based on X task proximity
3. **Fairness consideration**: Ensure balanced workload distribution
4. **Qualification matching**: Match workers to tasks based on qualifications

## X Task Handling

### Proximity Analysis
- **Last week X tasks**: Heavy penalty (+100 points)
- **Just finished X tasks**: Medium penalty (+50 points)
- **Starting X tasks soon**: Context-aware penalty (+75 points)
- **Upcoming X tasks**: Progressive penalty based on timing

### Rituk Exceptions
- **No proximity penalties**: Rituk workers bypass X task proximity penalties
- **Priority bonuses**: Rituk workers get significant priority bonuses
- **No violation bonuses**: Rituk workers don't receive violation bonuses
- **Special handling**: Rituk workers are handled specially in all contexts

### Warning System
- **High severity**: X tasks within 7 days
- **Medium severity**: X tasks within 14 days with closing conflicts
- **Low severity**: X tasks with potential closing conflicts
- **User notifications**: Automatic warning generation for conflicts

## Performance Optimizations

### Caching Strategy
- **Weekend assignment cache**: Prevents double assignments
- **Score calculation cache**: Reduces redundant calculations
- **Context analysis cache**: Stores analysis results for reuse

### Algorithm Efficiency
- **Two-phase processing**: Reduces complexity and improves performance
- **Context-aware filtering**: Early elimination of unsuitable candidates
- **Qualification indexing**: Fast qualification matching
- **Score pre-calculation**: Batch score calculations for efficiency

## Error Handling

### Validation Checks
- **Date range validation**: Ensures start_date <= end_date
- **Worker availability**: Checks for sufficient qualified workers
- **Qualification validation**: Verifies task qualifications exist
- **Data integrity**: Validates worker data consistency

### Exception Handling
- **Insufficient workers**: Graceful handling when not enough qualified workers
- **X task conflicts**: Automatic conflict detection and warnings
- **Score calculation errors**: Robust error handling for edge cases
- **Data corruption**: Validation and recovery mechanisms

## Usage Examples

### Basic Y Task Assignment
```python
# Initialize scheduler
scheduler = SchedulerEngine(workers, start_date, end_date)

# Assign Y tasks
assigned_workers = scheduler.assign_y_tasks(start_date, end_date)

# Get warnings
warnings = scheduler.get_x_task_warnings()
```

### Weekend Closing Assignment
```python
# Get weekend closing candidates
candidates = scheduler.get_weekend_closing_candidates(workers, current_week)

# Assign weekend closers
weekend_closers = scheduler.assign_weekend_closers(start_date, end_date)
```

### Score Management
```python
# Update worker scores
score_keeper = ScoreKeeper(workers)
score_keeper.update_worker_score(worker, "y_task", date)

# Get fairness adjustments
adjustment = score_keeper.get_fairness_adjustment(worker)
```
